### Description
Within the scope of the class theme, "The Anthropocene, Transhumanism and Non-human entities", <em> Black Box </em> seeks to explore the implications of a world growing increasingly dependent on automation and big data in order to cultivate meaning in our lives. Black Box is a wire brain sculpture with independent regions that can light up depending on the logic inside the black box. Based on thousands of posts collected from the internet and sentiment analysis, the hidden algorithm inside the box, inspired by the notion of "black box ai", determines which part of the brain is most relevant in expressing the sentiment implied from a web-scraped piece of text. In accordance with the patterns that exist within this data, it is naturally observed that the regions most associated with depression, anxiety, anger, and fear light up in the brain the most. Howevever, <em> Black Box </em> also comes with a microphone and an infrared distance sensor, so that when it detects the presence of another human being, the entire sculpture lights up all together.

The intention of this work is to show the emptiness of an intelligence artificially constructed on biased data. It is a commentary on the shifting of values within our society and how we define "meaning" during and after the AI revolution. Under capitalism, technological development is always driven by profit. When profit is the goal, the tools, companions, relationships, ecosystems, and mental pictures we build optimize towards compartmentalized and narrow visions. Interdisciplinary thought as well as natural empathy is abandoned, as we seek to artificially recreate these concepts by means of a rigorous, digital colonization of the human mental landscape.


 <em> Black Box </em> seeks to hint at the following questions:

1. What happens when we try to artificially build personalities?
2. What do personalities look like when they are developed with the goal of profit?
3. What does authenticity look like in the age of big data and machine learning?
4. What are the consequences of digitally mimicking concepts that have been abandoned under capitalism and the patriarchy instead of seeking them out organically?
5. As a result, how do concepts like: creation, identity, and status manifest in the transhuman efforts to digitally mimic such ideas?

### Research

 <em> Black Box </em> features a wire brain sculpture decomposed into 4 main parts: The right hemisphere, the brain stem, the amygdala, and the left hemisphere.

### Interpretations

### To Run
To run, first assemble arduino circuitry as shown in the /arduino/final_schematic.png file using the arduino micrsophone and IR sensor. Upload the code inside of the arduino/ folder or upload the StandardFirmata.ino code from the Arduino library. Finally, run the script inside of /python/.
