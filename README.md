### Description
Within the scope of the class theme, "The Anthropocene, Transhumanism and Non-human entities", <em> Black Box AI </em> seeks to explore the implications of a world growing increasingly dependent on automation and big data in order to cultivate meaning in our lives. Black Box AI is a wire brain sculpture with independent regions that can light up depending on the logic inside the black box. Based on thousands of posts collected from the internet and sentiment analysis, the hidden algorithm inside the box determines which part of the brain is most relevant in expressing the sentiment implied from a web-scraped piece of text. In accordance with the patterns that exist within this data, it is naturally observed that the regions most associated with depression, anxiety, anger, and fear light up in the brain the most. Howevever, Black Box AI also comes with a microphone and a IR distance senso, so that when it detects an interaction, the entire sculpture lights up all together.

### To Run
To run, first assemble arduino circuitry as shown in the /arduino/final_schematic.png file using the arduino micrsophone and IR sensor. Upload the code inside of the arduino/ folder or upload the StandardFirmata.ino code from the Arduino library. Finally, run the script inside of /python/.
